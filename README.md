<h1>PacMan Game (project tutorial)</h1>

<h2>Things that I learned:</h2>

- Learned more about addEventListener by using the 'keydown' event handler for the first time and applying that handler to the different arrow keys
- Created the board using a for loop and used the incremented value as the id
- Used if statements to check the layout array index and added a class to that particular element to be used in the game
- Learned some of the logic that was used to play the game such as adding, removing and checking the content classes of a particular element
- One of my first experiences using Class creation in JavaScript in order to create the different ghosts (Q: Class vs Object constructor usage)
- Learned some of the logic behind making the ghosts move randomly by using math random and floor to affect direction movement
- One of my first experiences using set Timeout
